1. Prayer

	</p>

	<!--<p><b><a href="https://madamdata.bandcamp.com/album/slug-savior" target="_blank">"slug/savior"</a></b>, album released on bandcamp. <br>-->
	<!--Made in collaboration with Philadelphia rapper, vocalist, activist, future alien queen Savan DePaul. "Experimental forms (structural, timbral, lyrical) let us tell stories about ourselves outside of the monoliths of white supremacist cultural organization. We want to be prismatic. We want to be expansive and obscure and luminous. We want to carry living histories. "-->

	<p><b><a href="https://purpletapepedigree.bandcamp.com/album/the-gospel-of-the-devourer" target="_blank">"the Gospel of the Devourer"</a></b>, album released on bandcamp. <br>
	<p  align="left">
	Several thoughts are with me: <br><br>

	1. That we live in a time marked by peculiarities of the language and motion of power, <br>

	2. That outside it is sunny, a temperature of 30 degrees celsius, and this is likely not to improve my mood, <br>

	3. That art and technology tend, through the lens of capital, to inscribe a teleology (an arc) of progress or forward motion throughout history, as does the territorial expansion of empire,<br>

	4. that my life for a good part of the past year has been characterized by violent sadness and anger,<br>

	5. and that my wrists, due to recent and sudden exposure to the ground, are in a state of fragility that limits my activities, and is reminding me to think certain thoughts (about the teleology of bodies, as we are taught) <br>


	In light of these ongoing concerns, and some others that it is unstrategic to mention, I came into the notion that I should kill and eat God, and have been setting diligently about this task for the past few months. Yesterday, the results of this work finally came to light, and I'm writing this email to offer you a chance to share in the meal. <br>

	The resultant noise/black metal - adjacent suite ('an ethnography of the vacuum, writ in spinal fluid and dark matter') is striking and unusual for me, and I don't have any insight into the process of making it or 'what it means'. These things are usually opaque to me. I think you might enjoy it. <br>

	<p><b><a href="http://thefloatingworldpodcast.com" target="_blank">"The Floating World"</a></b>, podcast available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-floating-world/id1444547815?mt=2" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/listen?u=0#/ps/Isvxkuvfz6icnvaz45rigfdwigq" target="_blank">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0e3LPSfm4xrzUC5ThvDPB7" target="_blank">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/7sy4w-885d8/The-Floating-World-Podcast" target="_blank">Podbean</a> etc. <br>
	
	<p  align="left">
	Each episode of the floating world is bricolaged together from bits of audio junk sent over from all corners of the world. The result is a pulsating mechanical unconsciousness: a love letter to the sleeping city and all its machinery, and to the bodies that manifest its conscience and brutality.

	<p><h3>press quotes</h3></p>

	<p><a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/madam-data-savan-depaul-slug-savior-feature" target="_blank">"There is an undeniable organic flow at the heart of Slug/Savior’s political missives, from the duo’s deconstructed approach to sound to their breathy lyrical delivery. There’s a true sense of liberation, especially for queer folks of color, as pervasive as the pre-apocalyptic street reporting." -Alex Smith, Bandcamp (2020)</a></p>
	<p><a href="http://thekey.xpn.org/2018/05/21/madamdata-a-thick-band-of-orange-light/" target="_blank">"The album murmurs and stirs in intense ambient spaces; this is no Brian Eno trying to make pretty background music for [insert location or medium here], it's more akin to early Juliana Barwick [...] using sound to capture feeling." -John Vettese, The Key WXPN, writing about "a thick band of orange light (2018)" </a></p>
