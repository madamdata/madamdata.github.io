	<!--BIOGRAPHY SECTION-->
	<a class="anchor" name="bio"></a>
	<p><h3>biography / biology / biometrics / biofeedback / bio</h3>
		Madam Data is a musician (composer) and sound scientist who explores machine and spirit interfaces. Their fantasies are about truly knowing what sacredness is, echolocating spaces infused with spirits, and begetting ghosts in the technology they create.  They seek a liberatory practice in these things. Madam Data works with synthesizers, handmade computer programs and circuits, field recordings and clarinets; they consider these objects to be interfaces with the Divine presence; they work with the sonics of stillness, space and brutal intensity.

	<p> <b><h3>notable sound and art things I have done recently:</h3></b>
	</p>

	<!--<p><b><a href="https://madamdata.bandcamp.com/album/slug-savior" target="_blank">"slug/savior"</a></b>, album released on bandcamp. <br>-->
	<!--Made in collaboration with Philadelphia rapper, vocalist, activist, future alien queen Savan DePaul. "Experimental forms (structural, timbral, lyrical) let us tell stories about ourselves outside of the monoliths of white supremacist cultural organization. We want to be prismatic. We want to be expansive and obscure and luminous. We want to carry living histories. "-->
	<!--</p>-->

	<p><b><a href="https://purpletapepedigree.bandcamp.com/album/the-gospel-of-the-devourer" target="_blank">"the Gospel of the Devourer"</a></b>, album released on bandcamp. <br>
	<p  align="left">
	Several thoughts are with me: <br><br>

	1. That we live in a time marked by peculiarities of the language and motion of power, <br>

	2. That outside it is sunny, a temperature of 30 degrees celsius, and this is likely not to improve my mood, <br>

	3. That art and technology tend, through the lens of capital, to inscribe a teleology (an arc) of progress or forward motion throughout history, as does the territorial expansion of empire,<br>

	4. that my life for a good part of the past year has been characterized by violent sadness and anger,<br>

	5. and that my wrists, due to recent and sudden exposure to the ground, are in a state of fragility that limits my activities, and is reminding me to think certain thoughts (about the teleology of bodies, as we are taught) <br>


	In light of these ongoing concerns, and some others that it is unstrategic to mention, I came into the notion that I should kill and eat God, and have been setting diligently about this task for the past few months. Yesterday, the results of this work finally came to light, and I'm writing this email to offer you a chance to share in the meal. <br>

	The resultant noise/black metal - adjacent suite ('an ethnography of the vacuum, writ in spinal fluid and dark matter') is striking and unusual for me, and I don't have any insight into the process of making it or 'what it means'. These things are usually opaque to me. I think you might enjoy it. <br>

	<p><b><a href="https://madamdata.bandcamp.com/album/for-agnes-martin-six-architectures-in-light-and-water" target="_blank">"for agnes martin, six architectures in light and water"</a></b>, album released on bandcamp. <br>
	
	<p align="left">
	I'm thinking about seeing Agnes Martin's work at a museum in Seoul and almost being moved to tears by the stillness, the calmness, the care, the patience, the love. In this music, I tried to trasmute the idea of a grid - not as an organizer of musical time (although that is a powerful paradigm in dance music) but as the sublimation of repetition and the feeling of stillness.

	<!--<p><b><a href="https://unheardrecords.bandcamp.com/album/all-the-rooms-i-have-been-touched-in" target="_blank">"All the rooms I have been touched in"</a></b>, album released on the internet by Unheard Records. <br>-->
	<!--This album was written during a point in time where my body had become very difficult to love, for myself especially, but regrettably also for other people. Part of that was becoming sick and losing my voice, and another part of it is that I’ve been living with Tourette syndrome for all of my life and the associated body horror has shaped me in more ways than I know.  I find that the act of resynthesis provides an exorcism of sorts, allowing me to reconsider learned relationships with my body. I remember then that the places I have been touched with love are a locus of power and healing, and I should seek them out more. I didn’t want this album to take me on any journeys; I didn’t want it to go anywhere. I wanted it to stay put, and allow me to be with myself.	</p>-->

	<p  align="left">
	Each episode of the floating world is bricolaged together from bits of audio junk sent over from all corners of the world. The result is a pulsating mechanical unconsciousness: a love letter to the sleeping city and all its machinery, and to the bodies that manifest its conscience and brutality.

	<p><h3>press quotes</h3></p>

	<p><a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/madam-data-savan-depaul-slug-savior-feature" target="_blank">"There is an undeniable organic flow at the heart of Slug/Savior’s political missives, from the duo’s deconstructed approach to sound to their breathy lyrical delivery. There’s a true sense of liberation, especially for queer folks of color, as pervasive as the pre-apocalyptic street reporting." -Alex Smith, Bandcamp (2020)</a></p>
	<p><a href="http://thekey.xpn.org/2018/05/21/madamdata-a-thick-band-of-orange-light/" target="_blank">"The album murmurs and stirs in intense ambient spaces; this is no Brian Eno trying to make pretty background music for [insert location or medium here], it's more akin to early Juliana Barwick [...] using sound to capture feeling." -John Vettese, The Key WXPN, writing about "a thick band of orange light (2018)" </a></p>
