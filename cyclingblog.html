		<h3>Fri 20 Nov 2020</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Went out cycling around the neighbourhood. There is a really great entry-level skinny by the canal near the power station. It's about 1-2 metres long and maybe 10cm wide, and it has a slope in and drops less than a foot on each side. After a few tries I sent it! While my wrist heals learning to ride skinnies has been salvaging my sense of challenge and progression. I'm gonna try riding this one as often as I can until I can nail it every time. </p>
		<p> Being out in the evening was beautiful. The weather was cool (which is a huge deal) and I felt like I was pushing myself in a very light and pleasurable way. I got to see nice buildings, be places I've never been and connect up places I have been. I sent some things, got bounced around a lot, and got more comfortable on the bike. Sometimes you don't have to have a major breakthrough. I'm still gonna fucking learn to wheelie and manual by January though. \>:(  </p>

		<p> BIKE REPORT I love this thing but it is a piece of trash. I've ordered the first set of serious 'upgrades' (is it an upgrade if you're just restoring functionality to a broken thing?) - 1. a rigid dirt jump fork to replace the absolute piece of spongy, leaky garbage that is the cross-country (?!) suspension the bike came with. 2. A whole new bottom bracket and crankset. I really hoped to be able to make it through a few months on the BMX cranks that were on it but they have started making an extremely loud creaking and I think it's a matter of days or weeks before a catastrophic failure. In the past I could fix that by disassembling, cleaning and re-greasing, and re-tightening all the bolts but that has stopped working. Also they're super rusty and the bearings don't turn or sit straight. I went with a cheap option that should be compatible with nicer cranks if I need to replace them down the road. </p> 
		<p> THE CANAL ROUTE Lest you write me off as a dirty pavement rider (seriously I am not good enough to warrant even that dismissal) I've been doing a short and sharp cardio race most mornings on a 6km PCN route. Current best time: 19mins 45seconds. Pretty alright, but definitely tiring.</p>
